  If your label and packaging meet UK requirements they will be correct for France too. That’s because rules have been harmonised across the EU.

  You may need to translate some or all of your label. A lot of companies use stickers for this purpose.

  You are normally responsible for clearing goods through UK customs. If you’re using a freight forwarder, for example, they can do this for you.
