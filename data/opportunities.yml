  title: Future seine-nord europe canal maitre d’oeuvre (moe) contracts
  published_date: 2015-11-01
  summary: €3.3bn construction of a large-gauge inland waterway link between France, Belgium and the Netherlands – calling civil engineers & architects
  content: |
    ## Overview

    This European project includes the construction of a large-gauge inland waterway link between France, Belgium and the Netherlands along the North Sea-Mediterranean European multimodal corridor, in order to provide a more effective multimodal link between the other transport modes, the seaports and inland ports of the North of France and of Europe.

    The future Seine-Nord Europe canal, which is located at the heart of the Seine-Scheldt network, stretches over 107 km. It will link the river Oise at Compiègne to the Dunkerque-Escaut canal at Cambrai.

    With its 4 multimodal platforms and its 6 goods trans-shipment stocks, the Seine-Nord Europe canal will fill in the missing link of the Seine-Scheldt large-gauge inland waterway link and will open up the Seine basin by linking it to the 20,000 km of the large-gauge European inland waterway network.

    The purpose of the Seine-Nord Europe canal project is to remove the bottleneck between the Oise Valley and the canal from Dunkerque to Valenciennes, along the Canal du Nord, which currently restricts the traffic to boats with a displacement of no more than 700 tonnes and the number of locks are an obstacle to the expansion of inland waterway transport and the creation of a network of multimodal inland ports. It will improve the mobility of goods using inland waterways between France and its neighbouring countries and will help to create and consolidate multimodal platforms and container terminals at a regional, national and European level in a progressive way over the long-term.

    The total cost of the works is estimated at €3.3 billion, exclusive of tax.

    The project has sustainable development and eco-design, architectural and landscaping objectives and needs to address employment and social responsibility solutions to ensure the exemplary status of the Seine-Nord Europe canal project.

    Initial tenders are for the MAITRE D’OEUVRE (MOE) CONTRACTS.

    Voies navigables de France (VNF), the French public agency of waterways, will present the project’s objectives and VNF’s expectations at an information day in London on 10th December. This is a unique opportunity to discuss in detail the scope and technical needs of the Project owners prior to the tenders’ publications.

    ### Deadline

    The initial deadline is for interested parties, notably civil engineering cabinets and architects, to participate in an information day in London on 10th December. There will be an opportunities to have one to one bilateral meetings on the technical elements of the project.

    The first tenders will be published in the next few days, following which there will be a period of 45 days to respond. Once the tenders are published, the project Owners will be limited in the information they will be able to give.
