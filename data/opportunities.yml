      * Architectural Design
      * Conservation Architect
      * Planning Consultant
      * Civil &amp; Structural Engineering
      * Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering
      * Quantity Surveying

    Applicants must be capable of providing all the listed services to the IPS.
    Having regard to the range of services required, firms or individuals may
    combine to provide these services

    Candidates will initially be evaluated by way of a Suitability Assessment

    Potential services include assistance with returns, website promotion, VAT
    reporting and more – making it easier for you and your customers

    There are a number of reasons why Swedish consumers consider buying online
    from the UK. Among the most important are:

      * UK prices are often considerably lower than Swedish prices
      * Swedes speak English very well – English is definitely Sweden’s main second language – and so Swedes are comfortable making purchases on UK websites

    However, Swedes are also used to benefitting from relatively generous consumer
    protection and for some product types, products can be returned at no
    additional cost within 14 days of the purchase date. These kinds of terms are
    not always available from international e-retailers and sending products back
    to an international retailer can cost the consumer the equivalent of £20-30.

    The Swedish company that is in contact with UKTI is looking to help remove
    this potential barrier to purchasing by helping to consolidate returns and
    make the returns process as pain-free as possible for the consumer.

    Whilst dealing with returns would initially be the core of this service, the
    company is keen to add further services, such as helping with VAT reporting in
    Sweden (where applicable), as well as promotion of your website in Sweden.
    Additional potential services may become apparent as needs change and a
    relationship grows.

    Opportunity for foreign companies investing in PV projects in Brazil

    Since 2014, new Solar Energy auctions have been carried out by state
    governments in Brazil. As a result,  large scale projects are being developed
    and Solar Energy is now more competitive. If the industry continues to grow at
    the same rate, forecasts show that the market will generate  £800 million a
    year, only with the installation of large scale power plants (not including
    distributed generation).

    The two auctions that took place in august and November this year hired 833 MW
    and 929 MW respectively. The forecast of investment in solar power projects is
    about £ 1 billion.

    The Brazilian National Development Bank – BNDES recently released conditions
    to financing machineries and systems for the new PV projects in Brazil. The
    financial support is offered during the manufacturing process until the
    equipment commercialisation.

    UKTI can assist you on how to exploit this opportunity. If you want to receive
    more information, please register your interest below.

    The UKTI Team in Brazil can support your company to identify partners in the

    Proprietary technology with computer controlled pressure relieving surface
    effectively prevents skin breakdown leading to pressure ulcers.

    Proprietary surface technology is adaptable to wheelchairs, operating room
    tables, beds and other surface support applications. It is the only system
    which addresses all of the 4 basic causes of pressure ulcers: complete
    pressure relief, free air flow to dissipate heat, removing moisture under the
    patient, and eliminating shear forces across the skin. While relieving
    pressure at intervals exceeding medical and nursing standards, it will measure
    and record usage and automatically turn off when not in use to preserve
    battery.

    This record-keeping function saves the patient from being physically
    repositioned every 15 minutes, and avoids the necessity of logging this
    repositioning.

    The company is looking to connect with a UK partner to co-develop and
    commercialise new products using this technology.

    NEA has called for a tender for the feasibility studies for the implementation
    of district pneumatic waste conveyance system

    The Pneumatic Waste Conveyance System (PWCS) is an automated waste collection
    system. It conveys refuse by air suction from individual buildings through a
    network of pipes to a central location for collection. The system is fully
    enclosed and does not require manual handling and transfer of refuse. It is,
    therefore, a hygienic and efficient method of refuse collection.

    Kampong Bugis Precinct (Kg Bugis) consists of a total area of 17.4 ha with
    plans to develop into a private residential precinct with a total of about
    4,000 new Dwelling Units (DUs) and 12,000sqm of future commercial Gross Floor
    Area (GFA). The implementation of a DPWCS serving the entire Kg Bugis would
    result in the reduction of refuse trucks traffic in the precinct, which is in-
    line with the concepts of “sustainability” and “car-lite” that are envisaged
    for this precinct.

    Marina Bay Precinct is divided into 3 zones for the purpose of implementing
    and operating the DPWCS, each with a dedicated DPWCS capable of handling about
    100 tons/day of waste. Marina Bay Zone 1 (MBZ1) has an area of about 50 ha of
    reclaimed land around Marina Bay with a mix of commercial, hotel, residential
    and other uses. A Common Services Tunnel (CST) has been built in MBZ1 to house
    common utilities services such as district cooling, power, telecommunication
    and water. Space is provided in the CST to install DPWCS pipes to connect the
    surrounding developments in MBZ1 to DPWCS Central Station. The Central Station
    is to be fully located underground and integrated within the future
    development on the land parcel. Refuse from the surrounding developments can
    then be conveyed by DPWCS pipes to the central station for collection.

    Early Notice: A state government is planning to shift from its traditional ICT
    procurement model to a cloud-heavy, as-a-service model.

    The overhaul could cost between AUD2 billion and AUD3 billion with the
    contract to last about 10 years. The contract could be offered to multiple
    providers.

    The overhaul is about paying only for what used, moving away from owning and
    operating ICT infrastructure with outside companies hosting government data
    and various other ICT structures.

    So far the state's health, education, corrective services, transport, finance,
    and attorney-general's department have committed to taking part in the
    program.

    Police, Main Roads, and the Public Transport Authority will also be part of

    Largest onshore wind project developer in Belgium is actively looking for UK
    expertise in aviation radar mitigation

    The company is the second largest energy supplier in Belgium with a
    substantial part of their energy generation coming from onshore wind projects
    in Belgium.

    Their growth strategy in onshore wind over the next four years involves the
    installation of an additional 150 MW.

    As Belgium has five civil airports and a number of military airports, it is

    installations.

    To circumvent this, the Belgian company is interested in identifying UK
    companies that are active in aviation radar mitigation.

    A non-profit organisation is hosting a $20m global funding competition that
    aims to convert CO2 emissions into everyday products.

    The $20M funding opportunity will challenge the applicant to reimagine what
    can be done with CO2 emissions by incentivising and accelerating the
    development of technologies that convert CO2 into valuable products. The
    competition will have two tracks – one focused on testing technologies at a
    coal power plant and one focused on testing technologies at a natural gas
    power plant. Each track will operate as a separate competition on the same
    timeline.

    Teams will compete in three rounds for a total prize of $20 million: Round 1
    will choose a track and submit technical and business information about their
    technology, process, potential products, and how they plan to achieve the
    technical requirements and goals of the competition. Round 2 will demonstrate
    technologies in a controlled environment (such as a laboratory), using a
    simulated power plant flue gas stream. Round 3 will include a demonstration of
    technologies under real world conditions, at a larger scale.

    The $20 million prize will incentivise development of new and emerging CO2
    conversion technologies, accelerating them from laboratory testing to
    demonstration under real world conditions. The prize will help identify the
    most promising pathways for CO2 conversion and prove they can be deployed at
    power plants and other industrial facilities.

    a copy.

    The nominated materials will need to be approved by Qatar Rail – the project
    owner.

    We envisage orders being placed from Q1 2016 onwards.

    Qatar is investing £25 billion in an integrated rail network to meet the
    public transport goals of their ‘Qatar National Vision 2030’. The demanding
    people movement requirements of the FIFA World Cup 2022 is acting as an
    additional catalyst and delivery deadline.  The integrated rail network will
    consist of a four line metro, a light rail transit system and an international
    high-speed, long distance passenger line with an interconnected freight line.
    Tunnelling for the metro started in the summer of 2014; Qatar Rail are using
    an unprecedented 21 tunnel boring machines across the metro packages. There
    are 8 metro civils packages and a large metro Systems contract (including
    rolling stock, track and depots). The Long Distance civils and systems package
    has been delayed, but they have recently shortlisted 15 prequalified bidders.
    The tender is due for release in Q1 2016. In addition, the GCC has committed
    to the construction of an inter-Gulf rail network by 2032, linking the GCC
    states from Kuwait in the north of the region, to Oman in the south. Qatar’s
    own rail network will commence operations (testing and commissioning) in 2018,
    with the first phase to be completed by 2019.

With production of 1.54\nmillion barrels per day (bbl/d)in 2009, Kazakhstan is already a major\nproducer, and continued development of its giant Tengiz, Karachaganak, and\nKashagan fields is expected to at least double its current production by 2019.\nKazakhstan's sector of the Caspian Sea is believed to hold several other major\noil and natural gas deposits as yet unexploited. Steadily rising natural gas\nproduction is transforming Kazakhstan from a net gas importer to a net\nexporter. Natural gas development has lagged behind oil due to the lack of\ndomestic gas pipeline infrastructure linking the western producing region with\nthe eastern industrial region as well as insufficiency in export pipelines.\n\nThe lack of access to a seaport makes the country dependent mainly on\npipelines to transport its hydrocarbons to world markets. It is also a transit\nstate for pipeline exports from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

    Solicit research proposals for the development of innovative technologies and
    assays in support of HIV research

    The purpose of this opportunity is to encourage Small Business Innovation
    Research (SBIR) grant applications that focus on the development of sensitive
    and quantitative assays, methods, or imaging techniques, including the
    development or novel applications of imaging agents or probes that can be
    applied to the measurement of residual HIV reservoirs in HIV-positive
    individuals, who are on effective antiretroviral therapy. Such technologies
    are required to have commercial potential.

    The institution is especially interested in next-generation tools and methods
    that can quantitate replication-competent virus or integrated provirus or
    distinguish HIV-infected cells in situ. The new tools proposed in the
    application should provide substantially increased sensitivity,
    reproducibility, spatiotemporal resolution, and/or scalability, as compared to
    existing methodologies and be able to characterize the replicative capacity of
    HIV-infected cells and tissues. These novel technologies will aid in obtaining
    a fine-grained and dynamic view of the persistent HIV reservoir. In addition,
    they are interested in quantitative methods and analytical tools to assess the
    viral load, either replication competent or integrated provirus, in a
    reproducible manner so as to monitor the dynamic changes in persistent
    infection.

    Seeking organizations proposing to advance knowledge on the reasons behind the
    divergent trends in health and longevity at older ages

    The NIH R03 grant mechanism supports discrete, well-defined projects that
    realistically can be completed in two years and that require limited levels of
    funding. Examples of the types of projects that can be supported with the R03
    mechanism include, but are not limited to: pilot or feasibility studies,
    secondary analysis of existing data, small, self-contained research projects,
    calibration of measures across studies, linkages to administrative data
    sources, and development of research methodology. Because the research plan is
    restricted to 6 pages, an R03 grant application will not have the same level
    of detail or extensive discussion found in an R01 application. Accordingly,
    reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the
    problem, placing less emphasis on methodological details and certain
    indicators traditionally used in evaluating the scientific merit of R01
    applications including supportive preliminary data. Appropriate justification
    for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from
    other sources, or from investigator-generated data. Preliminary data are not
    required, particularly in applications proposing pilot or feasibility studies.

    ## Overview

    The Polish Social Insurance Institute (ZUS) has announced tender for the
    maintenance works of its Comprehensive IT System.

    This is a restricted, two-stage tender. At the end of the first stage a list
    of all interested suppliers will be narrowed down to 5 potential contractors
    that have the skills, experience and potential to perform such a complex
    contract and can compete in the second stage of the bidding procedures.

    Details of the tender:

    ·    Deadline for applying and supplying tender documents – 11/01/2016

    ·    Bid bond required – 15 million PLN

    ·    Award criteria: price – 60%, the most economic tender – 30% and concept
    of taking over maintenance works – 10%

    ·    Duration of contract: 48 months from signing the contract, but not sooner
    than 10/10/2017.

    ·    Order reference number: TZ/271/66/15

    ·    Language: Polish

    The contract of the current IT integrator, Asseco Poland, expires in October
    2017. The reason why a new tender is announced two years in advance is for the
    winners to have the time to familiarise themselves with the system before
    taking over its maintenance.

    An Italian Energy Service Company (ESCo) is looking for automatic centralised
    power factor correction units to be integrated into existing electrical
    systems equipped with a PV unit.

    The power factor correction unit should be able to work on all four generator
    and load quadrants (inductive generator, capacitive generator, inductive load
    and capacitive load), namely when the electrical system is absorbing power
    from the grid and when it is feeding energy into the grid.

    The unit should also be able to protect the capacitor from the harmonic
    currents produced by the inverter inside the PV plant which may cause quick
    deterioration. The unit should therefore come with either special capacitors
    such as metallised Polypropylene film capacitors or special filters.

    ## Overview

    The city will host Azerbaijan’s inaugural F1 Grand Prix in 2016; the 2017
    Islamic Solidarity Games; and four games for UEFA EURO 2020.

    With a wealth of natural resources the ‘Stans’ are increasingly devoting
    significant budgets towards hosting, and bidding for, major sports events and
    other non-sporting events (e.g. Baku 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, Astana Expo
    2017).  With support in-country at the highest political level, and limited
    domestic capability these events perhaps offer the greater business
    opportunities for companies with  event delivery capability, and more limited
    opportunities around the delivery of the necessary infrastructure required.
    Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan are at the forefront of this movement
    with each country either hosting or bidding for a major event.

    Following the the inaugural European Games in June 2015 Baku is also to host
    further international sports events: in 2016 the city will host Azerbaijan’s
    inaugural F1 Grand Prix; in 2017 the Islamic Solidarity Games; and, will host
    three group games and one quarter-final match for UEFA EURO 2020 - each of
    these events may provide further opportunities particularly for UK companies
    that successfully helped deliver the European Games.

    To a lesser and greater degree, across the Central Asia major sports events
    HVO, we expect to see the following opportunities accessible for UK companies:
    transport, security, event delivery (security, stewarding, training, event
    management, media signage, ticketing, screens, temporary overlay, crowd
    control, transportation and branding), hospitality and catering, and legacy.

    UKTI has appointed a dedicated Business Specialist from industry to identify
    business opportunities around Azerbaijan’s major sports events and to support
    UK companies to pursue these business opportunities.

    The UKTI Global Sports Projects team in London is also on hand to speak to UK
    companies about this project, as well as other Global Sports opportunities.

    **High Value Opportunities (HVO) programme**

    The high value opportunities programme identifies large scale overseas
    projects offering the most value to UK Plc and aims to provide an intensive
    level of support to help UK businesses win contracts in and around these
    opportunities.

    Opportunities in planning, facility management and games delivery

    With a wealth of natural resources the ‘Stans’ are increasingly devoting
    significant budgets towards hosting, and bidding for, major sports events and
    other non-sporting events (e.g. Baku 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, Astana Expo

    domestic capability these events perhaps offer the greater business
    opportunities for companies with event delivery capability, and more limited
    opportunities around the delivery of the necessary infrastructure required.
    Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan are at the forefront of this movement
    with each country either hosting or bidding for a major event.

    Turkmenistan has been investing to become the most popular destination in
    Central Asia for major sporting events. In 2017 Ashgabat will accommodate more
    than 5,000 athletes from 62 countries competing across 17 sports when it hosts
    the 5th edition of the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games. The Ashgabat
    Olympic Complex, estimated to cost around £3.5 billion, will host the Games
    across 10 competition venues including two indoor arenas, a velodrome, an
    indoor athletics facility, tennis centre and an aquatics centre. The Athletes'
    Village is set to accommodate around 12,000 beds once completed.  Although the
    Turkish company Polimeks is taking a significant role in delivering the
    infrastructure necessary to host the Games, UK companies have had success and
    will expect to win more business particularly from the estimated £250-300m
    operational budget.

    Construction and infrastructure projects for the Games have already been
    commissioned but there will be opportunities in the areas of planning,
    facility management and games delivery in the run up to the games.

    To a lesser and greater degree, across the Central Asia major sports events
    HVO, we expect to see the following opportunities accessible for UK companies:
    transport, security, event delivery (security, stewarding, training, event
    management, media signage, ticketing, screens, temporary overlay, crowd
    control, transportation and branding), hospitality and catering, and legacy.

    Contract opportunities over the next 6 months; Torch &amp; medal design and
    production; Brand &amp; communication; Facility management; Professional
    services/cost management.

    UKTI has appointed a dedicated Business Specialist from industry to identify
    business opportunities around AIMAG 2017 and to support UK companies to pursue
    these business opportunities.

    The UKTI Global Sports Projects team in London is also on hand to speak to UK

    Petrobras’ investments in the “pre salt” oil fields off the coast of Brazil
    offer significant opportunities for UK companies.

    This multi-billion dollar investment by Petrobras provides opportunities for
    the supply of critical components, technologies, services and parts to the oil
    &amp; gas and shipbuilding sectors which the Brazilian sector groups have said
    it will remain unviable to manufacture in Brazil, and so must be imported.

    UKTI’s aim is to engage at a high-level with key players (both commercial and
    political), hold events to showcase UK capability, highlight opportunities to
    UK companies, work with UK and local companies to understand and satisfy the
    Brazilian Government’s local content requirements and working with UK Export
    Finance to provide lines of credit.

    UKTI is working closely with Petrobras, and Brazilian prime contractors, to
    identify specific project opportunities for UK companies, and to facilitate
    introductions into the international and local supply chains.

    The investment will mean a number of new opportunities for suppliers and
    potential partners. Further details on specific opportunities around this
    project will be provided as they become available. In the meantime, UK
    businesses interested in this project are encouraged to register their
    interest below.

    ## Overview

    US$10bn of investments already announced for Naval shipyard and shipbuilding
    programme (HVO BRA-16). Current projections up to 2020 estimate demand for
    500+ new ships and 20 new shipyards.

    In the 1950’s to 70’s Brazil had a thriving and well developed shipbuilding
    industry for mainly general cargo vessels. This peaked at the end of the 1970s
    only to slump in the eighties due cost of build and operation under Brazilian
    flag. The revival of the shipbuilding sector came about from 1998 onwards
    driven by exploration and finds by Petrobras in Brazil’s offshore oil and gas
    industry. The first vessels produced in this new phase were support vessels
    for rigs and oil production platforms (these latter produced abroad). Later,
    in 2001, PETROBRAS launched its Program for the Modernization of the Supply
    Vessel Fleet.

    This Program was successful and moved to its second phase when it was decided
    that Brazilian shipyard companies would participate in the construction of a
    variety of marine platforms, supplying some of the modules built from oil
    tanker hulls for platforms built abroad. This led in 2003 to the Government
    supporting a policy that assembly of the modules onto the platforms and
    finalisation of the production units should take place in Brazil. This in turn
    led to the commissioning of large semi-submersible platforms to be built
    partially or completely in Brazil. This step sealed the reactivation of a
    number of shipyards and attracted foreign investment into the Brazilian
    shipbuilding industry. The Brazilian content on these platforms has
    progressively increased since.

    In 2006, TRANSPETRO, the national crude oil shipping line, selected through
    process of public tender, the Brazilian shipyards to build the first 26 new
    oil tankers for the modernization and expansion of their fleet.  This changed
    the scale of the Brazilian shipbuilding industry, ensuring the activity of the
    shipyards and generating thousands of new opportunities for skilled jobs. As a
    result  in 2007, the shipbuilding industry was confirmed into the PAC Plan
    (the Federal Government’s program of accelerated growth in reality means the
    Brazilian National Development Plan), as one of the most relevant sectors for
    the fulfillment of the country’s strategic goals in terms of generating job
    opportunities and increased GDP growth.

    Entry into the PAC Plan assured provision of investment from Central
    Government into shipyard infrastructure and for the expansion and
    modernisation of national shipyards, which was a key pre-condition to Brazil
    being able to fulfill its own demand for vessels and platforms. Funding to
    Brazilian shipyards is supplied through the Merchant Marine Fund to cover the
    shipyards’ risks in the vessel construction phase.

    Further details on specific opportunities around this project will be provided
    as they become available. In the meantime, UK businesses interested in this
    project are encouraged to register their interest below.

    ## Overview

    Building of 74 Offshore support vessels (OSV) offers opportunities for UK
    suppliers of navigation systems, marine propulsion systems and ship design.

    The Brazilian Shipbuilding industry has 87 ordered vessels under construction.
    The average cost of each vessel is £50 million. Estimates demonstrate that the
    Brazilian shipbuilding market will still demand an additional 236 offshore
    supply vessels by 2020, of which, 89 should be constructed in Brazil.

    The UKTI team conducted a survey which showed that more than 80% of the
    components of a Offshore Support Vessel is imported by the Shipyards. If you
    would you like to know how much of your product Brazil is importing, the UKTI
    Team can assist you with that.

    If you product is demanded by the shipbuilding industry, please send us the
    import code known in Brazil as NCM (Common Nomenclature of Mercosur) with 8
    numbers and we will provide you with a brief report

    The report will include:

    · Amount of imports between 2010 – 2014

    · Market share for each country

    ## Overview

    MTR Corp is undertaking five projects to expand Hong Kong's railway network by
    55km to 275 km by 2020.

    Estimated total cost at outset of projects was £12.5 billion. There is an
    estimated £7.2 billion of project value remaining (note:this figure has been
    revised down from the original evaluation form, with an accessible value
    estimated at 80% for UK companies).

    **Project outline: **

    1\. West Island Line: 3km extension of MTR Island Line, 3 stations (completion
    in 2014; total project cost was £1 billion)

    2\. Express Rail Link: 26 km long twin bored tunnels; a 15 platform new
    underground terminus in West Kowloon (completion in 2015; total project cost
    was £5 bn)

    3\. South Island Line East: 7km medium capacity railway, 3-car Urban Line type
    trains, 4 stations and 1 depot (completion in 2015; project cost £1bn)

    4\. Kwun Tong Line Extension: 3 km long, 2 stations(completion in 2015;
    project cost £500m)

    5\. Shatin to Central Line: a total 17km long, 10 stations. Comprises 2
    sections. East-West Line 11 km from Tai Wai to Hung Hom (completion in 2018)
    and North-South Line 6km extension of the East Rail Line from Hung Hom to Hong
    Kong Island through a fourth rail harbour crossing (completion in 2020; Phase
    I &amp; 2 project cost £5bn)

    Beyond these five new schemes, Hong Kong has started to look farther into the
    next round of rail projects. Future plans currently under review with the
    railway development study (and out of scope of this HVO) include Northern
    Link, South Island Line -West, North Island Link and West Express Line linking
    Hong Kong International Airport with Shenzhen Airport. Hong Kong is poised to
    have a good 15-year railway development programme.

    These five new railway projects are under various stages of construction and
    planning. For West Island Line, civil works already commenced in 2009 and all
    procurement complete. In the case of Express Rail Link, civil works commenced
    in Jan 2010 with civil procurement completed end 2011. E&amp;M procurement
    commenced in 2011 with completion in 2013. For South Island Line (East) and
    Kwun Tong Line Extension, major civil and some E&amp;M contracts have been
    awarded. For Shatin to Central Link, detailed design of the Tai Wai to Hung
    Hom section is very advanced. More than £3 billion of works value on Shatin to
    Central Link alone will be tendered out, the procurement programme for which
    is scheduled to take place from 2012 to 2016.

    The Sultanate of Oman, along with other members of the Gulf Co-operation
    Council (GCC) union, is setting up its first ever railway system – Oman Rail
    (OR).

    While the rest of the countries in the GCC union, with the exception of
    Bahrain, have moved on with their respective projects, Oman is yet to award
    the first three contracts of OR (tender process for phase 1 in process and due
    to be awarded in December 2014). The total GCC railway project spend is valued
    at $110 billion; of this, the cost of building Oman’s 2244 kilometres (rather
    than the originally envisaged 1061km) railway line is expected to be $15
    billion. The GCC railway is projected to be operational during the 2016-18
    timeframe. The GCC project, involves construction of a 2117 km rail network
    which will run along the coast of the Arabian Gulf extending from Muscat in
    Oman to Kuwait City in Kuwait and passing through Saudi Arabia and UAE with an
    option for a Saudi Arabia to Manama (Bahrain) line as well as a 110 km
    extension from Saudi Arabia to Doha in Qatar. The network will carry
    containers, dry bulk, cement, sand, rock, aggregates and petrochemical
    products and will help reduce freight traffic and ease road congestions.

    A leading Japanese electronics company is seeking rectifying antennae.

    A leading Japanese electronics company is seeking rectifying antennae
    (sometimes referred to as rectenna) as a means of RF energy harvesting.

    The device will collect energy from the radio waves which are present in the
    atmosphere, particularly in towns and cities. An example of the energy cycle
    would be how smartphones emit radio waves, and at the same time receive
    electromagnetic waves at the back of the phone, which are then stored as
    energy in the battery.

    The concept may still be in the early stages of research and development, but
    if British universities are studying the theory and practicality of it, then
    the Japanese company would be interested in discussing it with them.

    For more information, please register your interest below ensuring to send us
    your brief company and product information together with website address.
    This will enable the UKTI Japan Technology Team to make initial assessment and
    if appropriate, liaise with the Japanese company about your enquiry.

    Opportunities in billing, customer/data management and smart metering
    technology.

    In April 2016, the retail sale of electricity will be fully liberalized in
    Japan as one of the steps towards power market deregulation. In the next year
    the retail sale to households and small-lot users, which is worth about 7.5
    trillion yen (about £40 billion) of the market value, will open to new
    entrants.

    The power market in Japan has been dominated by regional monopolies in areas
    ranging from power generation to transmission/distribution to retail sales.
    However, the Government have decided to unbundle the market by 2020 and more
    dynamic changes in the power market will be expected in the coming years.

    In the face of the full liberalization of the electricity retail market, major
    utility companies and new power retailers are seeking something that can
    differentiate them from their competitors. Also, many Japanese companies from
    other sectors such as telecoms and retailers have started entering into the
    energy businesses and seek unique and innovative products/services that can be
    introduced to the Japanese market.

    There will be strong opportunities in the following areas:

    Systems for various areas

      * Billing, customer management, database management, energy management, demand response management

    Hardware

      * Smart metering technology

    The local company would like to act as an intermediary to introduce UK
    technologies and services which could make a big impact on this new market
    place.

    If you are interested to this opportunity it is essential to respond to us
    with a description of your business and your company website information. The
    UKTI Japan team will get in touch with you directly to explain the next steps.

    Infrastructure opportunities in Christchurch.

    New Zealand is in the midst of its largest infrastructure investment programme
    in the existence of the country. The leading investments are being made in the
    two largest cities, Auckland and Christchurch. Auckland is set to increase its
    population by 1 million by 2040, from 1.6m. Investment by local and national
    government into transport, commercial and residential infrastructure is
    forecasted at £13.5bn in the next 5 years, combined with considerably greater
    private sector investment.

    Christchurch in New Zealand suffered two major earthquakes on 4 September 2010
    and 22 February 2011, the second of which caused wide scale destruction,
    concentrated largely in the central and eastern areas of the city, along with
    185 fatalities. The city suffered 7,930 aftershocks that further contributed
    to the extent of destruction.

    These natural disasters had a substantial impact on the whole of New Zealand,
    not just the Canterbury region in which Christchurch is located. Christchurch
    is New Zealand’s second largest city, after Auckland, and the South Island’s
    largest city, with a population of approximately 363,000 people, and 406,000
    in Greater Christchurch. The central city area, which is the focus of
    redevelopment, is 608 hectares. The New Zealand government, along with
    Christchurch City Council have committed spending of NZ$15bn to the
    reconstruction of Christchurch and the wider Canterbury region. The full cost
    of reconstruction is estimated at NZ$40bn with the NZ$25bn deficit expected to
    be sourced through investment from private sources. It is anticipated that the
    rebuilding process will take up to 15 years.

    ## Overview

    Demand for electricity in Vietnam is growing rapidly. By 2050 Vietnam is
    projecting 20-25% of this supply coming from nuclear power plants.

    The main focus of activity is at the initial power plants at Phuoc Dinh and
    Vinh Hai in Ninh Thuan province. In June 2010 the Vietnamese government issued
    a master plan covering Ninh Thuan 1 &amp; 2 power plants with a total of eight
    1000 MWe-class reactors. Since then intergovernmental agreements have been
    signed with Russia and Japan for the first two power plants. As part of this,
    a large number of students have been undertaking training in Russia and Japan.

    Discussions have also been held with South Korea as a basis for future
    cooperation on projects, this culminated in an agreement in March 2012.

    Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) will be the company responsible for the building
    and operation of these first two plants.

    The nuclear industry in Vietnam is in its very early stages and therefore
    presents an ideal opportunity to introduce UK companies to those responsible
    for the delivery of the programme. It appears that the major construction
    works and operation will be undertaken by EVN but as an inexperienced
    organisation they will need some advice on how best to procure and operate the
    plants. It is also clear that the intervention of Russian and Japanese
    companies will leave UK companies with some catching up to do.

    However there remain opportunities for UK companies in specialist areas:

    • Education and Training

    • Consultancy services

    • Regulation and safety management

    • Security

    • Operation management

    • Waste management

    The UK already has a number of companies with the necessary expertise in these
    areas and are recognised as world leaders in their fields.

    UKTI has created a special unit in post to develop and strengthen
    relationships with the delivery authorities and likely main contract suppliers
    as part of the High Value Opportunities (HVO) programme.

    The High Value Opportunities programme is UKTI’s flagship initiative that
    identifies, prioritises and supports UK businesses of all sizes to access
    large scale overseas procurement projects that offer huge contract
    opportunities for British business.

    ## Overview

    There are many opportunities for UK companies in deepwater exploration,
    development and production and also in conventional hydrocarbons.

    Mexico’s oil reserves are declining and the development of the country’s oil
    deepwater projects are crucial to the optimal recovery its reserves. Deep
    water reserves account for more than half of PEMEX’s prospective hydrocarbons
    reserves.

    The opportunities for UK companies lie in areas of support for maintaining
    production in declining fields, achieving a more efficient exploitation of
    proven reserves, increasing security and minimising environmental impact.

    The Mexican government has enacted constitutional reforms ending PEMEX's
    monopoly on the oil and gas sector and opening it to greater foreign
    investment. The reforms allow for new exploration and production contract
    models: licences, production-sharing, profit-sharing, and service contracts.
    Previously, only service contracts, in which companies were paid for services
    and were not allowed shares or profits derived from the hydrocarbon resources,
    were allowed for foreign firms. PEMEX will remain state-owned but will be
    given more budgetary and administrative autonomy and will have to compete for
    bids with other firms on new projects. The new regulatory authorities will be
    letting the contracts.

    UKTI is working with Pemex, and the main contractors in Mexico, to identify
    specific project opportunities for UK companies, and to facilitate
    introductions into the international and local supply chains.

    Expansion of Hong Kong Airport from a two to a three runway system

    In the late 90’s, Hong Kong completed a replacement International airport on
    an island reclaimed from the sea. This has two runways and is operating near
    capacity which has led to additional terminal buildings and apron capacity
    being built between the runways. The practical maximum runway capacity of the
    existing two-runway system of Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is about
    420,000 flight movements annually and it is estimated that the airport will
    reach its maximum capacity sometime between 2019 and 2022. In 2011 the Airport
    Authority carried out a three-month consultation to gauge public opinion on
    HKIA's future development. Seventy-three percent of respondents supported the
    proposal to expand HKIA into a three-runway system to meet the airport's long-
    term growth demand. Under a three-runway system, HKIA will be able to
    accommodate 620,000 flight movements per year, meeting demand projections up
    to and possibly beyond 2030.

    Infrastructure development opportunities in the Philippines.

    The Philippines’ PPP programme has been identified as the way to tackle much
    needed infrastructure development, supported by relevant economic and
    regulatory reforms, greater transparency and good governance. 2011 closed with
    the successful bidding of the first PPP road project valued at £ 22.8M, and
    January 2012 kicked off with the tender for PPP school buildings project.
    Under its PPP initiative, the government is determined to catch up on much
    needed investment in transport infrastructure and is keen on approaching this
    in a clear and transparent manner. It has also set aside budgets for right-of-
    way acquisitions on several infrastructure projects and established the PPP
    Centre with initial funds to support project development and monitoring.

    The projects offer opportunities for UK products, services and expertise that
    can be accessed by participating in the bidding process or tapping supply
    chain opportunities through direct supply opportunities, or partnerships.
    Opportunities can be categorized into two main areas, which are;
    Infrastructure that includes planning, construction, maintenance and
    equipment; and, Specialist Expertise in project management, consultancy,
    financing and insurance.

    and develop these openings with the chance to influence host Governments and
    support regulatory and master plan development.

    The HVO includes a strong education and capacity building strand as well as
    helping shape policies on local content. We are mapping the needs of EPCm
    contractors in the region against UK capability; building key commercial and
    political relationships in the region; gathering and sharing market
    intelligence with UK industry and advising on procurement processes and
    specific procurement milestones for the projects.

    • Opportunity to further help UK operators already positioned in these markets

    ## Overview

    Opportunities related to energy, rail, airport and ports.

    Energy: Opportunities existing in the design and construction of new power
    plants (coal, thermal and hydro), the refurbishment and upgrade of existing
    plants, supply of products and equipment and provision of specialist
    engineering and asset management services. The Government has set out
    progressive policies on promoting the use of renewable fuels and sustainable
    technologies.

    Rail: The development of and investment in rail infrastructure in Indonesia
    has been slow but is vital both in supporting commuter expansion and moving
    freight. Expansion in mining sector development in outlying areas is seeing
    further investments. The government is also pushing ahead with plans to

    ## Overview

    The Polish Ministry of Labour has announced a 5-year programme to keep the
    elderly active with the budget of over £60 mln.

    Due to the aging of Polish society and growing needs of elderly people,
    Ministry of Labour and Social Policy is starting a program called “Senior –
    Wigor” to address those needs.

    The program will be carried out in years 2015-2020 and it will include every
    Voivodeship (province). Once the local government unit receives funds for the
    program it is obliged to carry out the program for at least 5 years. The
    program is designated to be a supplement to the governmental program for
    social activity of elderly people in years 2014-2020. “Senior – Wigor” program
    will be revised on a year-on-year basis in order to implement evaluation
    findings to improve the efficiency of the program. Under the programme, local
    governments will be obliged to organise day care/activation centres for the
    elderly thus needing products and services.

    **Aims of the program**

    The strategic goal of the program is to support local governments in
    developing the network of day centres “Senior – Wigor” and “Senior – Wigor”
    Clubs, particularly with attention to rural and rural-urban communities in
    which there is a insufficient social support infrastructure for elderly
    people.

    The program aims to support senior citizens by offering care, activity,
    education, culture, recreation and health support including basic movement
    rehabilitation.

    The program is a part of polish social policy and includes:

      * Financial support for local governments in carrying out their tasks
      * Improving senior citizens’ lives
      * Granting seniors with the help and support adequate to their needs
      * Social integration of elderly community, including development of self-help
      * Increasing seniors’ involvement in local communities’ work and life

    **Program implementation**

    Day centres are supposed to be a place of everyday activity for senior
    citizens and they are supposed to play a role in socializing and integrating
    seniors, providing them with a place for rehabilitation both in group and one-
    to-one sessions. Senior clubs are meant to motivate seniors to pursuit self-
    help and voluntary work.

    Day centres and clubs are meant to be a combination of university of the third
    age, rehabilitation place and a place of meetings were elderly people could
    socialize and integrate with each other.

    **Program Financing**

    Between 2015 - 2020 The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy plans to invest
    360 m PLN in the program. The yearly spending is as follows:

    2015 – 20m PLN

    2016 – 40m PLN

    2017 – 60m PLN

    Thai TV broadcaster is looking for new education/entertainment content from UK
    for new children channel.

    Thailand has been in transition to Digital TV since The National Broadcasting
    and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC) granted 24 commercial digital licenses
    to 19 companies in early 2014. As a result, the number of free TV channels has
    increased from 6 channels to 24 channels. The transition to digital TV has
    spurred large-scale investment and sharp rise in demand for content.

    The strategy of the new digital TV operators is not only to upgrade their
    studio and equipment but also to add new programmes as advertising revenue
    grows, in order to minimize the mismatch of content-production costs and
    advertising income.

    One of the country’s broadcasters has expressed strong interest in sourcing UK
    edutainment content for their new children and family channel.

    For further information, please register your interest with the team in UKTI
